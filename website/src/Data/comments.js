      Hi Guys - I am only known to one member of your squad that I bumped into in the Bike Shed, Exeter this week. As I explained, I did the ride with 15 others last year (Cycleforce) from bottom to top so your first photos are bringing back great memories.
      Congratulations on surviving the trip to the top - that believe me was the worst part of our event, the best is now to come.
      Enjoy the Highlands, watch out for any unfriendly Aberdeen Angus (they can walk through anything), hope the wind is favourable today and I look forward to reading any reports you make.
      Just a note re spares. Get some brake blocks, not just because they wear out but some are held in with split pins which can and do drop out.
      Will try and make contact when you hit Exeter.
      Jon Drew
      By the way...
      An Irish bloke goes to the doctor
      Dactor, it"s me ahrse. I"d loik ya ta teyhk a look, if ya woot.
      So the doctor gets him to drop his pants and takes a look.
      Incredible he says,there is a 20 pound note lodged up here.
      Tentatively he eases the twenty out of the man"s bottom, and then a
      10 pound note appears.
      This is amazing exclaims the Doctor.  What do you want me to do?.
      Well fur gadness sake teyhk it out man shrieks the patient.
      The doctor pulls out the tenner and another twenty appears, and another
      and another etc...
      Finally the last note comes out and no more appear.
      Ah Dactor, tank ya koindly, dat"s moch batter, how moch is
      dare den?.
      The Doctor counts the pile of cash: 1,990 pounds exactly.
      wait for it....
      Ah, dat'd be roit. I knew I wasn't feeling two grand!
      Safe riding.

If you want Chris I could always send you a can of WD40 for you to spray on your bike AND legs.  Keep up the good work all of you, just think of all that you are achieving and the help you will give to others.  Lots of love, Elaine/Mum

      19 Sep 03 - Day One - John O Groats to Drumnadrochit

      135 miles, 12 hours on the road, 9 hrs actual cycling.

      The team woke early on a crisp and clear September morning all excited about starting the ride. It was going to be a long day and for many it was going to be the furthest they had every ridden.  The ride started at a brisk pace and the first stop was at 20 miles and all the team were going strong.  The first challenge was at about 40 miles where there was the first "real" hill.  This proved to be an "epic" thankfully the support teams were at the top of the hill to provide moral and physical support.  The next 30 miles were extremely picturesque unfortunately; however, the head wind meant that most people had to work hard to maintain the pace.  Lunch was at 70 miles where a much needed chip shop provided the necessary fuel to keep going.  On completion of lunch the team carried on and stopped again at the 100 miles point to take on board essential fluids. The team moved on this time moving at an increased pace.  Everyone by now was tired but determined to finish.  The last hill was at 125 miles and was an extremely long drag, thankfully the last 3 miles in were down hill and after 12 hours on the road and 9 hours in the saddle the team arrived at the bunkhouse.  Only 7 days and 820 miles to go!!

      Looks like you are all making good progress. Would like to see a bit more effort from Harry because it seems all he does is drive the bus. He reminds me of Otto the bus driver from The Simpsons.
      If you can get a Chad Photo of him with race shirt and strides on cycling up a hill (steep one) we will donate 20 pounds to CLIC. Good luck will follow progress and hope to see you when passing through Taunton at warp factor 7.

      Well done guys for completing a tough stage - Scotland. Just think that its all down hill now to Cornwall. Based on the Pics, spirits are still high as everyones always smiling (or is it straining !). 
      I would be intrested to know what equipment repairs has occurred during the journey (Bike equipment not human). Simon the lads in Exbridge have an idea for additional sponser-ship at the end of the trip, and thats Auctioining off your cycling shorts on e-bay. 
      Just like to advise you now that I will not be bidding....uggghhh!!

    Comment: HI there Warren (Bez) and everyone else as well. By the time you get to read this hopefully you will have triumphed over the ride south from Birmingham. Just want to say well done to all of you - not just for making this trek but also for the entertainment. The pictures and the e.mails are fantastic. Hope that someone in your command and control chain has had the good sense to get some publicity organised for your arrival at Lands End. Take care and love you lots. Mum xxx

    Comment: Well done to all of the Royal Marines and their supporters. I hope that after such a fantastic effort your comanding officers and superiors reward you all with some well earned relaxation time (and maybe even a productivity bonus). Seriously, you are a fantastic credit to your profession. I hope that these kinds of efforts (on top of those more serious ones which you get involved in) will be rewarded fairly.

    Comment: Excellent to escort you from Ottery St Mary to Newton Poppleford yesterday afternoon. I didnt expect you until Friday afternoon when I had planned a "high vis" escort down the A30. Never mind. Perhaps next time. What is it they say..P.P.P.P.P.P??? I didnt know there was a reception part at The Cannon or I would have stopped for a swift pint....of water and a photo opportunity! Best of luck on the final leg. See you for a swift one on your return SM!

Alison, Harriet, Pheobe, Erika , Chloe and myself all drove down this afternoon to support the guys on their last leg and it was worth it. Spirits were high and in true style they were sprayed with champagne as they finished, followed by a huge piece of Alison&#8217;s home made cake to keep them going on the journey home.  Well done to each and every one of you, enjoy some well earned rest

    Comment: The day after, and feeling a bit funny - perculiar.  Body has now turned into a locust; so am trying to resist the urge to eat everything that I see!  Many, many thanks to all the web supporters, we were all astounded that this exciting jaunt / long painful episode (delete as applicable) generated so much kind enthusiasm.  As pleased as punch, as I feel now - if Mick Cooper asks me to come along next year, I know what my answer will be.  But have refrained from printing it here, since a class of school children have been visiting this site.  Much love, Cxxx

    Comment: Hi - sorry the site went down (for over a decade...) it has now been restored in beautiful React. Some bits have had to be changed. The flash menu - flash isn't a thing anymore. And the wap site? Who even remembers wap. But the photos still look great. I hope this restored site brings some joy to the people who worked so hard to do something positive for good casues - and their friends, family and supporters.
