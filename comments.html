As I explained, I did the ride with 15 others last year (Cycleforce) from bottom to top so your first photos are bringing back great memories.
Congratulations on surviving the trip to the top - that believe me was the worst part of our event, the best is now to come.
Enjoy the Highlands, watch out for any unfriendly Aberdeen Angus (they can walk through anything), hope the wind is favourable today and I look forward to reading any reports you make.
Just a note re spares. Get some brake blocks, not just because they wear out but some are held in with split pins which can and do drop out.
Will try and make contact when you hit Exeter.
Jon Drew
By the way...
An Irish bloke goes to the doctor
Dactor, it"s me ahrse. I"d loik ya ta teyhk a look, if ya woot.
So the doctor gets him to drop his pants and takes a look.
Incredible he says,there is a 20 pound note lodged up here.
Tentatively he eases the twenty out of the man"s bottom, and then a
10 pound note appears.
This is amazing exclaims the Doctor.  What do you want me to do?.
Well fur gadness sake teyhk it out man shrieks the patient.
The doctor pulls out the tenner and another twenty appears, and another
and another etc...
Finally the last note comes out and no more appear.
Ah Dactor, tank ya koindly, dat"s moch batter, how moch is
dare den?.
The Doctor counts the pile of cash: 1,990 pounds exactly.
wait for it....
Ah, dat'd be roit. I knew I wasn't feeling two grand!

135 miles, 12 hours on the road, 9 hrs actual cycling.

The team woke early on a crisp and clear September morning all excited about starting the ride. It was going to be a long day and for many it was going to be the furthest they had every ridden.  The ride started at a brisk pace and the first stop was at 20 miles and all the team were going strong.  The first challenge was at about 40 miles where there was the first "real" hill.  This proved to be an "epic" thankfully the support teams were at the top of the hill to provide moral and physical support.  The next 30 miles were extremely picturesque unfortunately; however, the head wind meant that most people had to work hard to maintain the pace.  Lunch was at 70 miles where a much needed chip shop provided the necessary fuel to keep going.  On completion of lunch the team carried on and stopped again at the 100 miles point to take on board essential fluids. The team moved on this time moving at an increased pace.  Everyone by now was tired but determined to finish.  The last hill was at 125 miles and was an extremely long drag, thankfully the last 3 miles in were down hill and after 12 hours on the road and 9 hours in the saddle the team arrived at the bunkhouse.  Only 7 days and 820 miles to go!!</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><th scope="row">Claire</th><td class="d-none d-md-block">Message To Riders</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Well Done guys!

I hope this restored site brings some joy to the people who worked so hard to do something positive for good casues - and their friends, family and supporters.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div></span></div></div></main><div class="container bg-primary rounded"><div class="row mt-4"><div class="col-12"><p class="text-center text-white mb-0 mt-1">John2Land.co.uk</p><p class="text-center text-white mb-1 mt-0 textFooterSubheading">18th anniversary edition</p></div></div></div><div class="pb-2"></div></span></div><script src="https://cdn.driscoll.co/js/bundle.js"></script><script>!function(e){function t(t){for(var n,i,l=t[0],f=t[1],a=t[2],c=0,s=[];c<l.length;c++)i=l[c],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,i)&&o[i]&&s.push(o[i][0]),o[i]=0;for(n in f)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(f,n)&&(e[n]=f[n]);for(p&&p(t);s.length;)s.shift()();return u.push.apply(u,a||[]),r()}function r(){for(var e,t=0;t<u.length;t++){for(var r=u[t],n=!0,l=1;l<r.length;l++){var f=r[l];0!==o[f]&&(n=!1)}n&&(u.splice(t--,1),e=i(i.s=r[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},u=[];function i(t){if(n[t])return n[t].exports;var r=n[t]={i:t,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[t].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,i),r.l=!0,r.exports}i.m=e,i.c=n,i.d=function(e,t,r){i.o(e,t)||Object.defineProperty(e,t,{enumerable:!0,get:r})},i.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},i.t=function(e,t){if(1&t&&(e=i(e)),8&t)return e;if(4&t&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var r=Object.create(null);if(i.r(r),Object.defineProperty(r,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&t&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)i.d(r,n,function(t){return e[t]}.bind(null,n));return r},i.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return i.d(t,"a",t),t},i.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)},i.p="/";var l=this.webpackJsonpwebsite=this.webpackJsonpwebsite||[],f=l.push.bind(l);l.push=t,l=l.slice();for(var a=0;a<l.length;a++)t(l[a]);var p=f;r()}([])</script><script src="/static/js/2.65812ae6.chunk.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.93af9de8.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
